Datasets :
Professional performances : kaggle.com/datasets/jguerreiro/running
Dataset of the world's best athletic performances from 1970 to 2022 over distances ranging from 100m to marathon, men's and women's categories.
Average performances : own source

Most people tend to misunderstand or underestimate the humongous gap there is between the performances of the best sportsmen in the world to the average one.
Being familiar with the running competitive scenery, I will here use several various ways to represent this gap.
Being a big fan of running and competition, I was very interested in my own performances, but especially those of the world's best. 

The aim of this project is to highlight this gap via visualization methods that don't use direct figures, but rather more playful and visual means. 
Furthermore, we will also take the opportunity to compare the best runners with each other, and look at the evolution of human performance.
The main objective, is to make the elitism of the world's best understandable to a public who don't necessarily realize how good they are.

You will here be able to :
- Visualize the performance of an average runner and an elite runner (in different ways).
- Visualize the differences in performance between the average and the elite (in different ways).
- Visualize the evolution of the world's best performances over time.
